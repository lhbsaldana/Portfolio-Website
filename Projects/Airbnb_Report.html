        <h2 class="h4 my-2">What segments are doing well?</h2>
        <p>
          The Airbnb platform saw an increase in bookings for Rio in 2016, with a conversion rate of 74.92% from January to May. Most successful booking transactions have guest-host interactions of lengths between 5 to 15 messages, and response time is within 24 hours. This could imply that guests are satisfied with the host's reply even in such short engagement because most conversations are less than the maximum allowed messages sent per day, which is 25. Moreover, there are a lot of repeat bookers, which may imply a high customer satisfaction with the host's service. The number of new bookers is also high, meaning customers are willing to try out unique accommodations booked through the platform. The top three geographies are Brazil, France, and Great Britain.

        <h2 class="h4 my-2">What went wrong? </h2>
        <p>
          There has been a noticeable drop in bookers, particularly in July, and an alarming absence of bookings recorded in the last three months of the year. This suggests a significant downturn in customer engagement and interest during that period. 
          Additionally, Rio de Janeiro seems to need more popularity among foreign bookers, indicating a potential need for targeted marketing strategies or a reassessment of the destination's appeal to international audiences. This downtrend may mean that international guests are vigilant as the area's crime rates are high. Brazil ranked 11 for the highest homicide rate at 28.4 per 100,000 people in 2015 (The Global Economy). In addition, the annual robbery rate in the City of Rio has increased to 1,258 in 2015 from 1,225 in 2014 per 100,000 inhabitants, as reported by Statista. Moreover, the conversion rate has experienced a decline post-June, signifying challenges in turning potential interest into actual bookings. Furthermore, a concerning increase in response time has been observed since July, which could impact customer satisfaction and trust.

        <h2 class="h4 my-2">What could be done to improve?</h2>

          <li>Offer customizable itineraries to repeat bookers where guests can choose activities and tourist spots from a set of choices </li>
          <li>Develop interactive FAQs with answers to lessen response time. </li>
          <li>Obtain tourist count data from tourism department to have a broader perspective on the market dynamics</li>
          <li>Acquire a list of planned activities for the year in the region to help estimate potential visitor counts and align its supply accordingly</li>
          <li>Conduct competitor analysis to identify trends in occupancy and pricing strategies</li>
